# Treatise on Hebrew Grammar and Cantillation

*A Translation from Judaeo-Arabic*

---

## Chapter 1: On the Characteristics of Letters, Their Additions, and Their Positions

### Introduction

Know that the Hebrew language is composed of twenty-two letters, which are א-ב-ג-ד and the rest, called the letters of the throat (*ḥurūf al-qabla*). These letters are divided into five categories according to their points of articulation:

**The first category** is א-ח-ה-ע, which emerge from the back of the throat and are called the guttural letters (*ḥurūf al-ḥalqiyya*).

**The second category** is ג-י-כ-ק, whose articulation is from the middle of the tongue and the upper palate, called the palatal letters (*ḥurūf al-ḥankiyya*).

**The third category** is ד-ט-ל-נ-ת, whose articulation is from the tip of the tongue with the flesh of the teeth, called the lingual letters (*ḥurūf al-lisāniyya*).

**The fourth category** is ו-צ-ר-ש, whose articulation is from the teeth, called the dental letters (*ḥurūf al-sinniyya*).

**The fifth category** is ב-ו-מ-פ, whose articulation is from the lips, called the labial letters (*ḥurūf al-shafawiyya*).

### The Essential Nature of Letters

If you wish to know the points of articulation of letters, observe their essential characteristics so that this becomes clear to you. The essential characteristic of letters is like when you say א-ב-ג. When you say א (alef) in its entirety, it emerges from three points of articulation because it consists of three letters: the א from the guttural letters, the ל from the lingual letters, and the פ from the labial letters. Similarly, ב-י consists of two articulations: the ב from the labial and the י from the palatal. This is the case with all letters.

The essential characteristic of א is when you say א', like what you pronounce during reading. When you say ארץ, you do not pronounce from the א except its essential characteristic, and you drop the ל and פ because they are additional elements riding on the essential characteristic so that the essential characteristic of the letter becomes clear when pronounced with the letters individually.

Similarly, the ר (resh) from ארץ has its essential characteristic ר', which is what you pronounce during reading, while the י and ש are additional and are dropped during reading. Likewise, the צ (tzadi) is mentioned only for its essential characteristic, and the ד (dalet) is additional and is dropped during reading.

Thus, all letters have their essential characteristic as the original element, and the remaining letters are additional to complete the articulation of the letter individually. This explains the characteristics of letters, their additions, and their positions.

## Chapter 2: On the Four Necessities

The necessities are four in number. The meaning of necessity (*iḥtiyāj*) is need (*ḥāja*).

### The First Necessity

This is the need of the essential characteristic of the letter for additions so that the pronunciation of the letter individually becomes complete. They added letters to the letter to complete it, such as adding ל and פ to א, making it אלף. They added י and ת to ב, making it בית. They added י, מ, and ל to ג, making it גימל. This is the case with all letters. All of this is to strengthen the pronunciation with them individually. This is the first necessity.

### The Second Necessity

This is the need of letters for each other. When you say א or ב or other letters, the meaning is not understood from your speech except the name of the letter only. They combined letters with each other so that words are formed from them and the meaning is understood. For example, when you combine א, מ, and ר and say אמ״ר, it becomes a word and you know that its meaning is "he said." Similarly, ש, מ, and ר produce שמ״ר. In this manner, all speech is arranged, so letters became necessary for each other to understand meanings through them.

Know that speech is divided into three categories: noun (*ism*), verb (*fi'l*), and particle (*ḥarf*), which is called a particle of meaning (*ḥarf al-ma'nā*) and a particle of connection (*ḥarf waṣl*).

**Nouns** are like ראובן, שמעו, חמור, גמל, בגד, בית, כסף, זהב, and the like.

**Verbs** are like אכל, אמר, עשה, הלך or אמור, אכל, עשה, הלך, and the like.

Thus, it became clear to you that speech cannot be complete except after combining letters. This is the second necessity.

### The Third Necessity

This is the need of words for vowel points (*nuqūṭ*), which are the kings (*mulūk*). The explanation is that when you find ש, מ, ר (which is שמ״ר) without vowel points, you do not know how to read it—whether it is שָמֹר, שֹמֵר, שָמַר, שְמֹר, or שֶמֶר. When vowel points are placed on it, you know which of these it is, so the word became necessary for vowel points by necessity.

### The Fourth Necessity

This is the cantillation marks (*ṭe'amim*) because through them meanings are distinguished, and the pause and connection are known, and the past and future are known, and the first and second are known. For example, "לֹא קֹמִי אוֹרִי כִּי בָא אוֹרֵךְ" (Isaiah 60:1) is different from "לְיוֹם קוּמִי לְעַד" (Zephaniah 3:8) and "יְהוָה אוֹרִי וּמִשְׁעִי" (Psalms 27:1), as will be understood by whoever contemplates this. Similarly, הַבָּאָה הַבָּאָה שְׁבוּ שְׁבוּ and the like—were it not for the distinction of cantillation marks and their arrangement for meanings, the meaning of a sentence would not be understood.

Thus, it became clear to you that cantillation marks are necessary to clarify meanings. This explains the necessities.

## Chapter 3: On the Rules of א-ו-י-ה and ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת

Know that the letters in which *dagesh* and *rafe* are possible are six letters only, marked by ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת, because you say בּב, גּג, דּד, כּכ, פּפ, תּת. When a word begins with one of these six letters, it is sometimes with *dagesh* and sometimes with *rafe*.

### The Rule of *Dagesh*

The way to know this is to look at the word that precedes it. If the last letter of the preceding word is not from א-ו-י-ה, then the letter at the beginning of the second word is always with *dagesh*. For example, "בְּרֵאשִׁית בָּרָא" (Genesis 1:1)—the ב from ברא is with *dagesh* because it is from ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת and the last letter of the preceding word is ת, and ת is not from א-ו-י-ה. This is the case with all readings in this manner.

### The Rule of *Rafe*

If the last letter of the first word is from א-ו-י-ה and the cantillation mark on it is also a servant (*khādim*), then the first letter of the second word is always with *rafe*. For example, "וַאֶקְחָה פַּת־לֶחֶם" (Genesis 18:5)—the פ from פת became *rafe* because the last letter of ואקחה is ה, which is from א-ו-י-ה, and the cantillation mark on ואקחה is a servant, as will be explained when we mention the cantillation marks.

### The Soft Letters

The letters א-ו-י-ה are called soft letters (*ḥurūf al-madd wa-l-līn*) because they make the following letter soft. For their softness, they have types, and the letter that is attached to them is made *rafe*. Know this. This is the case with all readings: every א-ו-י-ה attached to ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת, when there is a servant on the first word, then the ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת letter is *rafe*, except for nine exceptions (*kawāṣir*), which are from ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת, preceded by א-ו-י-ה, with a servant on them, and they are with *dagesh*.

### The Nine Exceptions

**1. Ogeira** - This occurs in seven places only in all of Scripture:
- Four in שירת הים: "גָּאֹה גָּאֹה" (Exodus 15:12), "כִּי גָּאֹה גָּאֹה" (Exodus 15:22), "מִי כָמֹכָה נֶאְדָּר בַּקֹּדֶשׁ" (Exodus 15:11), "יִדְּמוּ כָּאֶבֶן" (Exodus 15:16)
- One in Isaiah 54:12: "וְשַׂמְתִּי כַּדְכֹד שִׁמְשֹתָיִךְ"
- One in Jeremiah 20:9: "וְנִלְאֵיתִי כַּלְכֵל וְלֹא אוּכָל"
- One in Daniel 5:11: "וְחָכְמָה כְּחָכְמַת אֱלֹהִים הַשְׁתַּכַּחַת בּוֹ"

**2. Pesiq** - When there is a *pesiq* between two words, it separates them, and ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת are with *dagesh*. For example, "עֵשָׂו כָּלָה" (Genesis 18:22)—the כ from כלה should be *rafe* were it not for the *pesiq* that came between the words.

**3. Dahiq** - This is the pressure and compression that occurs between words. For example, "וְהִזְהַרְתָּה בָּם" (Deuteronomy 31:28)—the ב from בם is with *dagesh* because there is only one cantillation mark between the *shofar* on the ע of והזהרתם and the ב from בם.

**4. Ati Meriḥiq** - When a word ending with א-ו-י-ה has two or more cantillation marks and the following word begins with ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת, the first word is compressed and attached to the ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת word, and the ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת letter is with *dagesh*.

**5. Mefiq He** - When a word ends with ה and the ה is pure in pronunciation, then the following ב-ג-ד-כ-פ-ת is with *dagesh*.

**6. Mefiq Vav** - When a word ends with ו and the ו emerges in pronunciation, then the following letter is with *dagesh*.

**7. Mefiq Yod** - When a word ends with י and the י is pure in pronunciation, then the following letter is with *dagesh*.

**8. Double Letters** - These are ב-ב and כ-כ only. When a word begins with ב or כ and there is a *shva* on the first letter, they are always with *dagesh*.

**9. Bet-Vet** - When a word begins with ב and the second letter is ו and there is a *shva* on the ב, it is with *dagesh*.

## Chapter 4: On the Vowel Points and Their Articulations

The vowel points (*nuqūṭ*) are called *neggamot*, and we have explained the need for them previously. There are eight vowel points: seven primary and one servant.

### The Seven Primary Vowel Points

**1. Ḥolam** - A dot between letters from above, like או. It is also called *melo pum* because it fills the entire mouth when pronounced.

**2. Qamatz** - A line with a dot below it, positioned under the letter from below, like בָרָא. It is derived from "וְקָמַץ הַכֹּהֵן" (Leviticus 5:12) because it gathers and compresses the mouth.

**3. Pataḥ** - A line only, positioned from below, like שַעַר. It is called *pataḥ* because it opens the mouth.

**4. Segol** - Three dots from below, like אֶרֶץ. It is also called *pataḥ qatan* because it opens the mouth slightly.

**5. Tzere** - Two dots from below, like תֵבֵל. It is also called *qamatz qatan*.

**6. Ḥiriq** - One dot from below, like עִיר. It is derived from "וְחָרַק עָלָיו שִׁנָּיו" (Psalms 34:12) because it grinds the teeth.

**7. Shuruq** - Has two forms:
   - When there is ו in the word, it is a dot inside the ו, like צוּר
   - When there is no ו, it is three dots with one below the second, inclined toward the south, like סְגֻלָּה

### The Eighth Vowel Point (Servant)

**Shva** - Two dots with one below the other from below, like שְמַע. It is called servant (*khādim*) because it serves with some of the seven on א-ח-ה-ע letters.

### Articulation Points of Vowel Points

- **Ḥolam**: The entire mouth, from the back of the throat to the lips
- **Qamatz**: The front third of the tongue and upper palate
- **Pataḥ**: The lower surface of the tongue entirely
- **Segol**: The sides of the mouth and lower surface of the tongue
- **Tzere**: The teeth, creating a gap between them
- **Ḥiriq**: The teeth, pressing them down with force
- **Shuruq**: The lips, bringing them together and raising them upward
- **Shva**: No specific position, but follows the vowel point it accompanies

## Chapter 5: On the Cantillation Marks

We have explained the benefit of cantillation marks and that they distinguish meanings from each other and clarify the meaning of a single word when it has multiple meanings.

### The Origin of Cantillation Marks

These signs and shapes and names are what the early fathers agreed upon from the time of Ezra the Scribe or before him. They made this the shape of *qamatz*, this the shape of *pataḥ*, this the shape of *ḥolam*, this the shape of *tzere*, and so on for all the vowel points. Similarly, this the shape of *zaqef*, this the shape of *etnaḥta*, this the shape of *zarka*, and so on for the rest.

They called the elements of cantillation and the elements of service by these names by convention and made them with signs and symbols so that students might be guided by them and the community might be instructed through them.

As it is said in Ezra: "וַיִּקְרְאוּ בַסֵּפֶר בְּתוֹרַת הָאֱלֹהִים מְפֹרָשׁ וְשׂוֹם שֶׂכֶל וַיָּבִינוּ בַּמִּקְרָא" (Nehemiah 8:8).

### The Twelve Primary Cantillation Marks

**1. Pazer** - The shape of a צ above the word
**2. Telisha** - A small circle at the head of the word  
**3. Tarṣa** - Two vertical lines above the word
**4. Yetiv** - An inclined line at the edge of the word from above
**5. Zaqef** - Two dots with one above the other on the word
**6. Etnaḥta** - The shape of an inverted צ head under the word
**7. Zarka** - The shape of a fishhook at the edge of the word from above
**8. Legarmeh** - The shape of a *shofar* from below with a *pesiq* after the word
**9. Revia** - A dot with one above the word
**10. Tevir** - The shape of a staff under the word with a dot
**11. Tifḥa** - The shape of a staff under the word inclined to the right
**12. Siluq** - Called *sof pasuq* because it only occurs at the end of verses

### The Eight Servant Marks

**1. Shofar** - The shape of a *shofar*
**2. Shofar Hafukh** - The shape of an inverted *shofar*
**3. Telisha Qetana** - Called *yareḥ ben yomo* because it is like the new moon
**4. Telisha Shemal** - The shape of *telisha* that is a cantillation mark
**5. Azla** - A staff above the word inclined to the right
**6. Merkha** - A staff under the word inclined to the left
**7. Darga** - The shape of a step
**8. Netuya** - The inclined one, also called *daḥuya*

## Chapter 6: On the Movements of Cantillation Marks

The twelve cantillation marks are divided into three categories according to their movements: elevated (*a'lān*), lowered (*waḍ'*), and raised (*raf'*).

### Elevated Marks
- **Pazer, Telisha, Tarṣa, and Siluq** belong to this category
- When you read a word with these cantillation marks, you raise the voice and elevate it upward with force

### Lowered Marks  
- **Yetiv, Zaqef, and Etnaḥta** belong to this category
- When you read a word with these marks, you lower it and do not elevate the voice with it, but lower it with a quiet lowering

### Raised Marks
- **Zarka, Legarmeh, Revia, Tevir, Tifḥa, and Siluq** belong to this category
- These are intermediate between elevated and lowered

## Chapter 7: On the Alternation of Cantillation Marks

The meaning of alternation (*tarāduf*) is when two *pazer*s occur together, one after another, or two *zaqef*s together, one after another, and the like.

### Marks That Can Alternate
Seven marks can alternate: **Pazer, Telisha, Yetiv, Legarmeh, Zaqef, Tevir, Zarka**.

### Examples of Alternation
- **Pazer** can occur as two together: "וַיְמַהֲרוּ וַיַּשְׁכִּימוּ" (Joshua 8:14)
- **Telisha** alternates only in one place: "בֹּא הֵנָּה וַאֲשַׁלְּחָה אוֹתְךָ אֶל הַמֶּלֶךְ" (2 Samuel 14:32)
- **Yetiv** can be two together: "וְאַתָּה וְאַהֲרֹן" (Exodus 24:1)

## Chapter 8: On the Service of Servants and Cantillation Marks

The meaning of service (*khidma*) is that the servant precedes the cantillation mark that it serves. For example, when the servant is in the first word and the served cantillation mark is in the second word, and the matter is not reversed.

### The Shofar of Position
- Serves six cantillation marks: **Pazer, Telisha, Tarṣa, Zarka, Revia, Yetiv, Tevir**
- Does not serve others

### The Shofar of Elevation  
- Serves three cantillation marks only: **Etnaḥta, Zaqef, Zarka**
- Also serves **Segola**

### The Inverted Shofar
- Serves only **Yetiv**

### The Small Telisha
- Serves only the great **Pazer**

### The Left Telisha
- Serves four cantillation marks: **Tarṣa, Yetiv, Zarka, Tevir**

### Azla
- Serves four cantillation marks: **Tarṣa, Yetiv, Zarka, Tevir**

### Merkha
- Serves six cantillation marks: **Yetiv, Zarka, Legarmeh, Tevir, Tifḥa, Siluq**

### Darga
- Serves two only: **Revia, Tevir**

### Netuya
- Serves two: **Etnaḥta, Siluq**

## Chapter 9: On the Proximity of Cantillation Marks

The meaning of proximity (*mujāwara*) is what is possible from cantillation marks that one of them comes after another without other cantillation marks separating them.

### Proximity Rules
- **Pazer** can be followed by: Telisha, Yetiv, Tevir, Tarṣa, Legarmeh
- **Telisha** can be followed by: Tarṣa, Zarka, Yetiv, Tevir  
- **Tarṣa** can be followed by: Revia, Telisha, Zarka, Legarmeh, Yetiv, Tevir
- **Zaqef** can be followed by: Tifḥa, Tevir, Telisha, Yetiv, Revia, Tarṣa, Legarmeh, Etnaḥta, Siluq
- **Etnaḥta** can be followed by: All cantillation marks
- **Segola** can be followed by: Most cantillation marks except Etnaḥta, Tifḥa, Siluq
- **Legarmeh** can be followed by: Revia, Tarṣa, Tarṣa, Yetiv, Tevir
- **Revia** can be followed by: Pazer, Telisha, Zarka, Yetiv, Tevir, Tifḥa (in one place only)
- **Siluq** cannot be followed by anything because it is the end of the verse

## Chapter 10: Special Rules for the Three Books

The three books **Psalms, Job, and Proverbs** have different cantillation marks and servants. They have eight cantillation marks and ten servants.

### Their Cantillation Marks
1. **Pazer** - "The voice will scatter"
2. **Revia** - "Will appear for cantillation marks"  
3. **Legarmeh** - A staff from above with a pause hanging between them
4. **Zarka** - "Will illuminate like faces and like a torch"
5. **Yetiv** - Like an early staff for the king from below
6. **Etnaḥta** - Restful and comfortable
7. **Tifḥa** - A dot from above and a staff that does not move
8. **Siluq** - "In it the end of the verse is known"

### Their Ten Servants
**Shofar, Shofar Mefazzez, Shofar Hafukh, Tsenorit, Maqel, Daḥuya, Shokhev, Netuya, Merkha, Shalshelet**

### Special Verse
There is one verse in these books that includes all the cantillation marks:

> "עַל זֹאת יִתְפַּלֵּל כָּל חָסִיד אֵלֶיךָ לְעֵת מְצֹא רַק לְשֵׁטֶף מַיִם רַבִּים אֵלָיו לֹא יַגִּיעוּ" (Psalms 32:6)
